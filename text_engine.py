TextEngine: A Gap Buffer Implementation for Efficient Text Editing

This class implements a "gap buffer" data structure, which is commonly used in text editors
for efficient insertion and deletion operations. The gap buffer maintains a contiguous block
of memory (a list in Python) with an empty "gap" that follows the cursor position.

Key Concepts:
- The buffer is a list with a gap (empty space) in the middle
- Text before the gap: buffer[0:gap_start]
- The gap itself: buffer[gap_start:gap_end] (contains None values)
- Text after the gap: buffer[gap_end:]
- When inserting text, we fill the gap from left to right
- When moving the cursor, we move the gap to follow it

Example buffer state with text "Hello World" and cursor after "Hello":
[H][e][l][l][o][None][None][None][ ][W][o][r][l][d]
                ^gap_start          ^gap_end

class TextEngine:
    """
    A text editor engine using the gap buffer algorithm for efficient editing operations.
    
    The gap buffer provides O(1) insertion at the cursor position by maintaining
    an empty gap that moves with the cursor. This is much more efficient than
    repeatedly inserting into a standard list, which requires shifting all
    subsequent elements.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, initial_capacity=100):
        """
        Initialize a new TextEngine with an empty gap buffer.
        
        Parameters:
        -----------
        initial_capacity : int, optional (default=100)
            The initial size of the buffer array. This determines how many
            characters can be stored before the buffer needs to be resized.
        
        Attributes:
        -----------
        self.buffer : list
            The main storage array containing both text characters and None values
            representing the gap. Initially filled entirely with None.
            
        self.gap_start : int
            Index pointing to the start of the gap (where new characters will be inserted).
            This represents the cursor position in the text.
            
        self.gap_end : int
            Index pointing to the end of the gap (one past the last None in the gap).
            Text after the cursor starts at this position.
        
        Initial State:
        -------------
        buffer = [None, None, None, ..., None]  (length = initial_capacity)
        gap_start = 0
        gap_end = initial_capacity

        # Create a buffer filled with None values to represent empty space
        self.buffer = [None] * initial_capacity
        
        # Gap starts at the beginning (cursor at position 0)
        self.gap_start = 0

        self.gap_end = initial_capacity

    def insert_char(self, char):
        """
        Insert a single character at the current cursor position (gap_start).
        
        This operation is O(1) when there's space in the gap, making it very efficient
        for sequential typing. The character is placed at gap_start, and gap_start
        is incremented, effectively shrinking the gap from the left.
        
        Parameters:
        -----------
        char : str
            A single character to insert at the cursor position.
        
        Algorithm:
        ----------
        1. Check if gap has space (gap_start < gap_end)
        2. If no space, print error message (resize not implemented)
        3. If space available:
           - Place character at gap_start position
           - Increment gap_start to move cursor forward
        
        Example:
        --------
        Before inserting 'A' with gap_start=0, gap_end=3:
        [None][None][None]
         ^gap_start       ^gap_end
        
        After inserting 'A':
        [A][None][None]
            ^gap_start  ^gap_end

    def set_cursor(self, new_pos):
        """
        Move the cursor (and the gap) to a new position in the text.
        
        This is the most complex operation in the gap buffer. When moving the cursor,
        we must also move the gap to follow it. This involves copying characters
        from one side of the gap to the other, effectively "sliding" the gap through
        the buffer.
        
        Parameters:
        -----------
        new_pos : int
            The desired cursor position (0-based index in the logical text).
            Position 0 means before the first character.
            Position n means after the nth character.
        
        Algorithm Overview:
        -------------------
        1. Calculate the actual text length (excluding the gap)
        2. Clamp new_pos to valid range [0, text_length]
        3. If gap needs to move left: copy characters from left to right
        4. If gap needs to move right: copy characters from right to left
        
        Time Complexity:
        ----------------
        O(d) where d is the distance moved. This is why gap buffers are efficient
        for local editing but slower for jumping to distant positions.
        
        Example - Moving gap LEFT:
        --------------------------
        Before (cursor at position 3, want to move to position 1):
        [H][e][l][None][None][W][o][r][l][d]
                   ^gap_start      ^gap_end
